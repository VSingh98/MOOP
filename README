run "make" to make all of the videos in this directory.
	This will perform a raw conversion of the video in the RawVideo directory.
	This will create two videos, using two different compression algorithms in both
		the Vertical and Horizontal directories.

run "make clean" to clean all of the directories

run "make new" to clean all directories and then make all of the videos.


We see from this program that, for both Horizontal and Vertical compression,
My, 8-block simplification algorithm creates smaller mp4 files than the 
binary-char-sum printing algorithm recommended by Jason.
