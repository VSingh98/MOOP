This program converts the raw text file into two mp4 videos using horizontal compression.
It converts a 640 x 480 image into 640 x 60 image

One of the mp4 videos was made using binary char printing compression.
	In this compression strategy, blocks of eight pixels were combined into a
	single decimal value between 0 and 255. Then, this unsigned char was printed
	to a yuv file. From this yuv file, then, we made an mp4 file using ffmpeg

The other mp4 videos was made using my own simplistic horizontal compression algorithm where
	I take a block of eight pixels, and if one of the pixels is contains a one, I assign that
	block of eight pixels the value of 255. Otherwise, if it is all 0s, I assign that block the
	value of 0. Then, I print this into a yuv file and create an mp4 using ffmpeg

In this program we see that both programs create yuv files of the same size, but my algorithm
creates smaller mp4 files than the binary char printing algorithm.

run "make" to make the raw video.
	This will store the .o file(s) in the bin directory
	This will store the yuv file(s) in the yuv directory
	This will store the debug file(s) in the debug directory
	This will backup the convert.cpp file in the backup folder 
		if convert.cpp was changed

run "make clean" to clean the 
	bin, debug, vid, and yuv directories

run "make new" to first clean this directory and then create the video
